# Hi there üëã

I'm a cybersecurity guy having an affair with software engineering.

This is my age, btw _(so that I don't need to update it every year)_:
```javascript
( birthday => (new Date(Date.now() - birthday)).getUTCFullYear() - 1970 )( new Date("1999", "02", "13") )
```


### Favorite languages

Go, JS (React), Python _(and everything else, that is properly documented üíô)_

### Very personal projects üòè

I'm usually using my own Gitlab instance profile at https://git.leon.wtf/leon and mirror the 'good' repos to Github.
